# ORDER BY EXERCISES

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name IN ('Irena','Vidya','Maya') ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

# Update your queries for employees with 'e' in their last name to sort the results by their employee number. Make sure the employee numbers are in the correct order.
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE 'e%' OR last_name LIKE '%e' ORDER BY emp_no DESC;

# Now reverse the sort order for both queries and compare results.
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE 'e%' AND last_name LIKE '%e' ORDER BY emp_no DESC;
